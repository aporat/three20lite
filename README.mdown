Three20
=======

Three20 is a collection of iPhone UI classes, like a photo viewer, and general
utilities, like an HTTP disk cache.  Three20 is derived from the
[Facebook iPhone app][], which is one of the most downloaded iPhone apps ever.

Documentation
==============================

You can access Three20 API documentation in several ways:

1. Online: http://aporat.github.com/three20/api
1. Within Xcode: 
    1. Open your Xcode Preferences (`âŒ˜,`) and switch to Documentation tab. 
    1. Click the `+` button
    1. Add the Three20 doc set feed: `feed://aporat.github.com/three20/api/com.facebook.Three20.atom`
1. Generate the documentation from the project repository with the `src/scripts/docs.py` script

An Overview of Three20
======================
                  
Photo Viewer
------------

[TTPhotoViewController][] emulates Apple's Photos app with all of its flick n' pinch delight.
You can supply your own "photo sources", which works similiarly to the data sources used by
UITableView.  Unlike Apple's Photos app, it isn't limited to photos stored locally.  Your
photos can be loaded from the network, and long lists of photos can be loaded incrementally.

Message composer
----------------

[TTMessageController][] emulates the message composer in Apple's Mail app.  You can customize it
to send any kind of message you want. Include your own set of message fields, or use the
standard "To:" and "Subject:".  Recipient names can be autocompleted from a data source that
you provide.

Web image views
-----------------------

[TTImageView][] makes it as easy to display an image as it is in HTML.  Just supply the URL
of the image, and TTImageView loads it and displays it efficiently.  TTImageView also works
with the HTTP cache described below to avoid hitting the network when possible.

Internet-aware table view controllers
---------------------------------------

[TTTableViewController][] and [TTTableViewDataSource][] help you to build tables which load
their content from the Internet.  Rather than just assuming you have all the data ready to go,
like UITableView does by default, TTTableViewController lets you communicate when your data is
loading, and when there is an error or nothing to display.  It also helps you to add a "More"
button to load the next page of data, and optionally supports reloading the data by shaking the
device.

Better text fields
------------------

[TTTextEditor][] is a UITextView which can grow in height automatically as you type.  I use
this for entering messages in Facebook Chat, and it behaves similarly to the editor in Apple's
SMS app.

[TTPickerTextField][] is a type-ahead UITextField.  As you type it searches a data source, and
it adds bubbles into the flow of text when you choose a type-ahead option.  I use this in
TTMessageController for selecting the names of message recipients.

HTTP disk cache
--------------

[TTURLRequest][] is a replacement for NSURLRequest which supports a disk cache (NSURLRequest
can only cache in RAM).  It has some other nice features too.  HTTP posts are as easy as
supplying a dictionary of parameters.  The TTURL loading system can also be suspended and
resumed at any time, which is a great performance helper.  Network threads often fight with
the UI thread, so you can suspend the network any time your app is momentarily graphically
intensive.

URL-based Navigation
--------------------

[TTNavigator][] is for those grizzled old web developers like myself who want to
organize their app by "pages" which can be displayed by visiting a URL.

Your view controllers can simply register URL patterns that they handle, and when those URLs
are visited the controllers will be created and displayed.  You can also register generic
actions that are called when a URL is visited.

TTNavigator also persists and restores the full path of navigation controllers and modal
view controllers, so your users can quite the app and come back exactly where they left off.
